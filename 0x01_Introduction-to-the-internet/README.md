 The cording journey begun with alot of excitement!
 During  the first lsson we learnt about the internet. The lesson was very interesting vhaving learnt about it's history and everything that pertains the net.
We were given th course outline which included:
 1.  Front end
 2.  Back end
The flow was quite well until the first assignment that challenges st in.
It really took me a very long time for to come understand what I was to do for my assignment, but lucky enough my very close friend helped me figure it /
i have managed so far to create [Github Account](https://github.com/)
